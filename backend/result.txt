**Section C: Fill in the blanks (1 mark each)**

1.  The shape of a molecule with sp3d hybridization is __________.

2.  The band gap in an insulator is __________ than that in a semiconductor.


**Section D: Assertion-Reason Questions (2 marks each)**

1. **Assertion:**  The ionization energy of nitrogen is higher than that of oxygen.
   **Reason:**  The half-filled p-orbital configuration of nitrogen provides extra stability.

2. **Assertion:**  Hard acids prefer to bond with hard bases, and soft acids prefer to bond with soft bases.
   **Reason:**  This is explained by the Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) principle, which considers factors like charge density and polarizability.
