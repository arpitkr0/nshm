2.  Explain the band theory of solids.  Distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors. Describe the effect of doping on the band structure and conductivity of silicon.

3. Explain the periodic trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electron affinity.  Justify these trends using the principles of effective nuclear charge and shielding effect.

4.  Discuss the Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) theory and its applications in predicting the stability of complexes. Give examples of hard and soft acids and bases, and illustrate the theory with suitable examples of reactions.


**Note:** This is a challenging question paper designed for B.Tech students.  The numerical calculations in some MCQs and the detailed explanations required for the longer questions aim to test a deeper understanding of the subject matter.  Appropriate adjustments to the difficulty level can be made by modifying the complexity of the questions or reducing the number of questions in each section as needed.
